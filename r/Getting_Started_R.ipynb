    "1. The `conda config` command is the same as in the previous section. You don't have to repeat it if you've already added the `r` channel.\n",
    "2. The `conda skeleton` command creates a sub-directory, called `'r-colorramps'` in the current working directory. The 'recipe' for building the package is saved in this directory.\n",
    "3. Note: `conda` changes the name of the package for consistency and to avoid name conflicts (colorRamps is changed to r-colorramps). But within R you will still load the package with `library(colorRamps)`.\n",
    "4. The `conda build` command creates a conda package in the `'conda-bld'` subdirectory of your Anaconda installation directory. For instance, on my machine the file `'r-colorramps-2.3-r3.1.3_0.tar.bz2'` was created in the `'C:\\Users\\Michael\\Anaconda2\\conda-bld\\win-64'` directory. \n",
